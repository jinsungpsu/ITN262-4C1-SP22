// this file will contain all the data/operations
// related to the To Do List

/*
In this assignment, you will design and implement your own to do list application.  You will implement a custom class for a to do list with some public methods such as:
void addTask(String task)
this method will add a task to the to do list
duplicates are allowed, so no need to check
void removeTask(String task)
this method will remove a task (if it exists) to the to do list
if there are duplicates in this list, only remove ONE instance of the task
if the task does not exist, this method should throw an exception
String toString()
this method should return a String with all the tasks that are in the to do list
void clearAllTasks()
this method should clear out all the tasks in the to do list
